An classic game converted into a web application game which is built using React and Javascript and styled with CSS. 

Check out https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html for the full tutorial on how to create this app. This is a revamp version using React Hooks and function components. Helper functions from official React used for calculating winner.

Project Status

This project is currently in development. Users can select a point on grid to play their mark of "X" or "O". Layout and more UI to be implemented.

Reflection

I created this project as a side project to help me understand the uses of React Hooks. The aim was to create a working game which represents tic-tac-toe with some UI in mind to present the game as a web app.

The project is not large and is a good starter/side project to understand how you can use React Hooks and functional components. I found it challenging to determine how to evaluate winners and therefore consulted the React website and found that a tutorial of already exist for Class base version of the game on the React Official website. The helper junction was extremely useful and I put comments to further my understanding on how each line of code work.
